}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{analyze} object}

\item{report_filename}{The file name of the report (not including file extension, which is determined automatically)}

\item{output_format}{One of \code{"html_document"}, \code{"word_document"},
or \code{"pdf_document"}.  Note that \code{'pdf_document'} requires a

\item{output_dir}{The path to the directory that the report will be written to.  If NULL, written to current working directory.}

\item{simple_html}{If \code{TRUE}, overrides \code{output_format} and outputs a character object containing a simple (R Markdown v1) html report, useful for embedding in Shiny apps.}

\item{...}{passed to \code{\link{render}}}

Guttman's L4, Feldt-Gilmer, and Feldt-Brennan), item overview (difficulty, 
point-biserial correlation, corrected point-biserial correlation, number of 
missing responses, and probability of missing responses), and distractor analysis.

Rendering is done by means of \code{\link{render}} from the \code{rmarkdown}
package.  See that help page for more details on the rendering process.
